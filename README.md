very similar to the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) online database, which displays information related to films,
television programs and video games, including cast, production crew, fictional characters, biographies, plot
summaries, trivia, and reviews. It will use jQuery and AJAX methods to parse JSON data returned from a 3rd
party server, Open Movie Database (OMDB) API, to access their movie data.
